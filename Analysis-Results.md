Football Player Data Analysis

🔴As a result, the player with the highest contribution to the goal in 2021 is Robert Lewandowski.

🟠The data includes the most defender players.

🟡The reason why I compared Benzema lewandowski and Nkunku Wirtz in our data is because they are the youngest top scorers and the oldest top scorers.

🟢The precision calculation process does not seem very suitable for this dataset. Therefore, the result of this procedure may be quite low. I just wanted to show you how it's done

🔵In the decision tree process, since our data set is very large, the picture of the decision tree has become quite large. But I can still say that it works.

🟣We used a total of 8 different clusters to calculate the k value. Because the graph we made with the elbow trick method showed us to make a scatter graph with 8 clusters.

⚫️There is no regular progression of goals scored in matches in linear regression

⚪️From the summary table we can say that the cutoff (constant) coefficient is 12.7918 and the independent variable coefficient is 0.1910 (If Goals increases by 1 it means const increases by 0.0017 units)
  If the p value of the independent variable(s) is greater than 0.050, we say the variable is not significant and we can exclude the variable.
  In our case, we cannot say that this variable is significant since the p-value of Goals is greater than 0.000 and 0.050.
